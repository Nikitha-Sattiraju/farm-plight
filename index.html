    <h3> Why Indian Farmers Protest </h3>

      <p class="intro"> Indian farmers have been protesting over the last two years against the declining viability of agriculture in the country. Costs of cultivation have shot up but net farm returns have barely increased. Farmers are stuck in an
        endless cycle of debt to finance their farms. More than half of all farm households in India are debt-burdened, according to the country's National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO). And the inability to repay their debt has pushed many
        Indian
        farmers to suicide.</p>
      <br>

      <p class="intro">The present government promised to double farm incomes by 2022 and provide higher support prices to farm commodities but is yet to deliver. Their electoral promises and rising farm debt spurred the nationwide
        farmer protests.</p>

    <p class="ending"> Farming is increasingly becoming a gamble in India. There is no guarantee that you would get the same returns as in the calculator. As mentioned above, increasingly erratic climate can lead to complete crop failure.
      Ineffective seeds can lead to a lower-than-expected yield.
      <br>
      <br>
      A supply chain riddled with middlemen would, more likely than not, capture a share of your profits. And an overproduction of food can lead to crippling price crashes. Its no
      surprise, therefore, that rural households are now less and less dependent on farming for an income.</p>
